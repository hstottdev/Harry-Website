<h3> Personal Website </h3>
This is the code for my work-in-progress Portfolio Website.

<br>
I love Nintendo games. So, I've chosen to mimic the design of the Nintendo Switch Menus for my site.
<br>
<br>
I DO NOT CLAIM OWNERSHIP OF THE DESIGN OR LIKENESS OF THIS WEBSITE. NOR DO I DIRECTLY PROFIT FROM IT. IT IS MERELY A SHOWCASE OF MY SKILLS, PASSION, AND TO COMMUNICATE MY INTERESTS, AND GOALS.
