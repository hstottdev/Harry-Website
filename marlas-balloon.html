                    'Marla's Balloon' is a 2D precision platformer in which the player must manage damage to both their balloon and themselves. 
                    They must use the balloon's 'ghost rise' ability to gain height, lower their balloon to avoid glass creatures, and collect 
                    more balloons to replenish those that pop.

                    This was another project I worked on mostly by myself. It was adapted from my first-ever game project under the same name. 
                    I decided after the fact to spend a whole summer working on it, I had many ideas surrounding the world and setting being 
                    an alternative version of history set in the 1990s.
                    <br><br>
                    The only form of collaboration was reaching out to a friend for help with the music, as I wasn't comfortable with making 
                    my own at this stage. I also got help from another friend to make a trailer for the game.

                            Levels were designed with very specific goals in mind of not allowing the player to progress until they had learned something specific. They were also designed to be harsh, but beatable. Players who failed knew what they did wrong, and they sometimes needed to be a bit more careful with their balloons to give themselves a few extra hits. There were three sections to the game, the city, the sewers, and the boss encounter. Once reaching the sewers, the player would get a new ability, the hammer. This meant they could now destroy any glass objects they found, which helped to keep the gameplay fresh and different from the first part.

                            Many of the enemies were relatively simple, but there was somewhat of a focus on them being highly 'inanimate' as they were made from glass (Which also helped my bad animation skills). The two main enemies' actions were only to lean or fall into players to attack them. I also had enemies on skateboards which moved from left to right, which in the second half of the game can be killed and reaped off their boards! There were also flying enemies, which spawned from nests, these could also be broken once in the sewer part of the game.

                            The balloon mechanics were designed to be simple, but realistic. The balloon would behave with a certain amount of drag, acting at an offset to the player which was slightly delayed in its movement. The player had 2 separate fail conditions. When hit directly they lost one of their 2 hearts, which could be replenished by finding health. The balloon acted as a 'lives' counter, damage to the balloon would pop it lowering the number until all were gone. This was created in a way where the player had to manage both losing balloons and damage to themselves to make it through the level.

                            One key thing this game has that not many of my others do is a comprehensive boss encounter! A truck that the player passes over starts moving, and the player has to attack the 'skateboarding glass giraffe' by getting close with the hammer and smashing it to pieces! The rule of three was used here, each time the giraffe would hit, more sets of enemies would start spawning, and getting in the way of the player! Upon hitting for the third time, the giraffe would fall to bits and the player would win. This also involves a difficult system of a scrolling city in the background while the player is riding on top of the truck. This was accomplished through an image that perfectly joined together at each end and then moved accordingly with code.
